Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: If you're collaborating on a project, then it would useful to use a remote.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Maybe there could be a conflict between an update that someone else has pushed to
GitHub and what you have stored locally. Pulling changes manually also forces you
to keep better track of what work is being done on a project.
